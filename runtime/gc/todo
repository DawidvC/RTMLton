	why did i not have to add setPriority, etc? why does it still work?

	
s->atomicState is almost certainly going to need to be per-thread.



to complete paper:

- what needed to change to make threading work
- background on mlton threads
- implement coop sched or timeslice with models, but only single core, but can be adopted to multicore (cite multimlton) further details can be found here: cite mlton url/doc
- how do you get priorities into mlton
- how do we interface with the pthreads
- do we want 1:1 or many:1
